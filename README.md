# Caesar Cipher (Python)

A simple command-line Caesar Cipher program written in Python that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text messages by shifting characters using a secret key.

## Features

- Encrypt a text string using a secret numeric key.
- Decrypt an encrypted text string by providing the same key.
- Simple command-line interface.
- Educational and beginner-friendly implementation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (pre-installed on most systems)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hermela-code/PRODIGY_CS_01.git
   cd PRODIGY_CS_01```

Run the Caesar Cipher script using:
``` python3 caesar_cipher.py
  ```
How It Works:

   - When prompted, choose 1 to encrypt a message or 2 to decrypt a message.

   - Enter your message when asked.

   - Enter a secret numeric key (this will be your encryption key).

   - The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message accordingly.

## Note:
The encryption key you enter is not displayed during the encryption process.
Make sure to remember the key you used — you’ll need it to decrypt the message later.
